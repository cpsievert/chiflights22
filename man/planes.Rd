\format{
A data frame with columns:
\describe{
\item{tailnum}{Tail number.}
\item{year}{Year manufactured.}
\item{type}{Type of plane.}
\item{manufacturer, model}{Manufacturer and model.}
\item{engines, seats}{Number of engines and seats.}
\item{speed}{Average cruising speed in mph.}
\item{engine}{Type of engine.}
}
}
\usage{
planes

\description{
Plane metadata for all plane tailnumbers found in the FAA aircraft
registry. American Airways (AA) and Envoy Air (MQ) report fleet numbers
rather than tail numbers so can't be matched.
